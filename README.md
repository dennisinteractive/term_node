# Term Node

Allow a term to be configured to show the content on a referenced node rather than the default term view.

 - From a Term, in any taxonomy, I can select a node
 - When I have selected a node. when I visit the term page, the node is displayed on the term url
 - Content on the page comes from the Node
 - Meta data is loaded from the Node
 - When I visit the Node the `rel="canonical"` is set as the term url
 - When the node appears anywhere else on the site e.g. homepage, other term pages - the term url is used
